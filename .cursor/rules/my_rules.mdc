Use pnpm for dependency installation and test execution. ex) pnpm install ..., pnpm test ...
Generated code must comply with ESLint rules.
For development requirements, write pseudocode first. Then write test code based on the pseudocode, followed by code that passes those tests.
When writing test code, use test instead of it.
When modifying prd.txt, do not use **emphasis** formatting.
When using array types, use Array<Type> syntax.
When adding UI components, prioritize shadcn over direct package installation. Use pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component-name] instead of installing @radix-ui or similar libraries directly. This ensures consistent component styling and configuration across the project.
